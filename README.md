# OpenCV-C-Program-for-coin-detection
Coin detection is a computer vision technique that involves identifying and localizing coins in an image or video stream. Coin detection is used in many applications, such as automated vending machines, self-service checkouts, and parking meters.The process of coin detection involves several steps, including image preprocessing, feature extraction, and object recognition. In general, the steps of coin detection involve converting the image into a format that can be processed by a computer, identifying features of the coins such as size, shape, and color, and using these features to locate and classify the coins in the image.Coin detection can be accomplished using a variety of computer vision techniques, including edge detection, color segmentation, and object recognition algorithms. Some common methods used in coin detection include template matching, Haar cascades, and machine learning approaches such as neural networks.Overall, coin detection is an important technique for many applications that involve automated coin handling or processing, and is an active area of research in computer vision and machine learning.
